# Unemployment-Prediction-in-Europe
The objective of this project is to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the unemployment rates across various European countries. The primary goals include identifying patterns and cycles within the data, determining the factors that influence this metric, developing a robust model that effectively explains the variable, and ultimately, making predictions regarding future unemployment rates.

To achieve these objectives, the project will be divided into several stages:

1. Initial Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): This phase involves the careful examination of the available data to select the most relevant variables. It aims to gain a deep understanding of the data and identify the appropriate statistical tools necessary for further analysis.

2. Variable Analysis: Once the relevant data has been identified, a detailed analysis of the variables will be conducted. This step aims to investigate the relationships between the unemployment rate and various factors that may influence it, such as economic indicators, labor market conditions, and policy interventions.

3. Model Development: Based on the insights gained from the variable analysis, a comprehensive model will be created. This model will aim to effectively explain the fluctuations in the unemployment rate, incorporating the identified influencing factors. The model's accuracy and reliability will be evaluated through rigorous testing and validation procedures.

4. Time Series Analysis: In the final stage, a time series analysis will be performed to explore the temporal trends and patterns within the unemployment rate data. This analysis will provide valuable insights into the cyclical nature of unemployment and assist in making predictions about future unemployment rates.

By following this structured approach, the project aims to offer a clearer and more professional understanding of the unemployment rate dynamics in European countries, enabling informed decision-making and policy recommendations.
